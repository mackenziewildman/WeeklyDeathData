# Exploring weekly death data by region

First, a basic time series plot shows deaths by week for each broad region within the US. See [Plot 1](https://github.com/mackenziewildman/WeeklyDeathData/blob/master/plot1.png).

After noticing a peak in deaths in the Pacific region in week 16, [Plot 2](https://github.com/mackenziewildman/WeeklyDeathData/blob/master/plot2.png) shows weekly deaths in this region by age range. This peak in deaths in week 16 is mainly captured within the over 65 population but also noticeable in younger populations.

Next, weekly deaths in all broad regions are broken down by age group in [Plot 3](https://github.com/mackenziewildman/WeeklyDeathData/blob/master/plot3.png).

Finally, the 5 subregions with highest average weekly deaths in the given time period are shown in [Plot 4](https://github.com/mackenziewildman/WeeklyDeathData/blob/master/plot4.png). Further analysis may include population data by region so that a death rate can be analyzed instead of a nominal value.
